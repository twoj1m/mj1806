  <h3> Web</h3>

  <p>
  The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space
  where documents and other web resources are identified
  by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links,
  and accessible via the Internet.
  English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
  He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.
  The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research
  institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public
  on the Internet in August 1991.

 The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age
 and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio,
and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as
coherent pages of multimedia content.
